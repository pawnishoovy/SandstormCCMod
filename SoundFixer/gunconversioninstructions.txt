SandstormSecurity.rte\Devices\Weapons\Handheld holds all the gun folders

every single gun folder has the same name as the .ini, and the same name as the internal name used for definitions

i.e.

SandstormSecurity.rte\Devices\Weapons\Handheld\M3MAAWS

M3MAAWS.ini

Magazine M3MAAWS



every single gun folder has two folders inside: CompliSoundV2, and Sounds

every single sound name needs its own SoundContainer

i.e.

Add

Bass

Mech

AddStart

BassStart

MagIn

MagOut

etc...



MOST soundcontainers in CompliSoundV2 need to look like this:

AddSoundContainer = SoundContainer
	PresetName = Pre Judge
	AttenuationStartDistance = 250
	AddSound = Heat.rte/Devices/Weapons/Handheld/Judge/CompliSound/Pre1.ogg
	AddSound = Heat.rte/Devices/Weapons/Handheld/Judge/CompliSound/Pre2.ogg
	AddSound = Heat.rte/Devices/Weapons/Handheld/Judge/CompliSound/Pre3.ogg

that is to say, nothing special except 250 attenuation

EXCEPTION: all sounds with:

-Reflection
-End

in the name need to look like this:

AddSoundContainer = SoundContainer
	PresetName = ManualReflection Judge
	AttenuationStartDistance = 250
	SoundOverlapMode = Restart
	AddSound = Heat.rte/Devices/Weapons/Handheld/Judge/CompliSound/ManualReflection1.ogg
	AddSound = Heat.rte/Devices/Weapons/Handheld/Judge/CompliSound/ManualReflection2.ogg
	AddSound = Heat.rte/Devices/Weapons/Handheld/Judge/CompliSound/ManualReflection3.ogg

(key detail: Restart overlap mode)

all sounds in Sounds should be normal except for 170 attenuation
